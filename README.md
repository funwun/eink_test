# eink_test
some hardware and firmware to run a battery-powered electronic ink display

This is a NOT WORKING project with several known issues and quite likely unknown ones too.

USE DATA AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Three known hardware issues are a pinout problem with the 39 pin eink display connector, a PIC bpyass capacitor connection error, and an RX-TX swap issue with the bluetooth module.  Plus the code doesn't work.

This project was intended to be a quick layout-and-firmware operation based on projects at http://essentialscrap.com/eink/index.html and http://spritesmods.com/?art=einkdisplay.  I bit off more than I could chew for a weekend project however.

The purpose of uploading this to the internet is soley to ask for help fixing things, not to display a working good project.  Possibly may be fixed in the future but it is a sort of whimsical, should-be-fun project so all bets are off.
